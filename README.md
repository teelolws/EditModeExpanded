Expands Blizzard's Edit Mode to allow other frames to be moved, too.

 

There are two parts to this addon:

1\. EditModeExpanded: The addon itsself, which currently supports moving various parts of the base UI not already supported by Edit Mode, and adds resize and hide support to parts of the base UI that don't already have that option  
2\. EditModeExpanded-1.0: The library, which can be imported by other addons, to allow the other addon to make itsself movable in Edit Mode  
   
Currently supports:  
1\. Moving custom frames around during Edit Mode (Anything you'd like to move around that Blizzard didn't already highlight in Blue during Edit Mode!)  
2\. Saving the location of custom frames moved during Edit Mode, and restoring that location during login  
3\. Splits the Menu Bar from the Backpack Bar so they can be moved separately

4\. Resize custom frames, save and reload the custom size  
5\. Save settings per Edit Mode profile

6\. Option to change the menu buttons back to either the Shadowlands versions or the Black and White ones from early Dragonflight  
7\. Option to add back a recreation of the Dragonriding Vigor Bar, with the Algari Stormrider variant
